# 🚀 Techpro Academy Coding Bootcamp - Independent Workflow Guide 🚀

Welcome to Techpro Academy Coding Bootcamp! This guide outlines our streamlined workflow for independent learning and exercise submission. Please read this document carefully to understand how we work and collaborate.

## 1. Branch Structure 🌳

In Techpro Academy, we use a structured approach to organize our coding materials. Each module or topic has its own dedicated branch in our GitHub repository. These branches serve as a foundation for your learning journey.

Example Module Branch: `responsive-design`

## 2. Exercise Structure 💪

Within each module branch, you will find a collection of exercises. Each exercise is organized as follows:

- **Exercise READMEs:** Inside the module branch, you'll find individual exercise README files. Each README provides clear instructions, requirements, and resources for a specific task.

## 3. Getting Started 🚀

To begin working on an exercise, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the Techpro Academy Coding Bootcamp repository to your local machine.

2. **Create Your Branch**: Create your own exercise branch based on the module branch and your name. For example, if you're working on the "responsive-design" module and your name is John Doe, create a branch named `responsive-design/john-doe`.

3. **Work on the Exercise**: Implement your solution for the exercise within your exercise branch. Refer to the exercise's README for guidance.

4. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes to your exercise branch and push them to your remote branch on GitHub.

## 4. Submitting Your Work 📦

When you have completed an exercise, it's time to signal that your work is ready for reference and further learning. Here's the submission process:

1. **Draft Pull Request**: Create a draft pull request from your exercise branch to the module branch (e.g., from `responsive-design/john-doe` to `responsive-design`). Mark the PR as "Draft" during the creation process.

2. **Code Reference**: Your completed exercise branch serves as a reference for future learning and assessment.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions 🤔

### Q: How do I get feedback on my code?

A: This workflow is designed for independent learning. While we've omitted formal code reviews, you can always seek help or clarification from instructors or peers if you encounter challenges.

### Q: How do I track my progress?

A: We recommend maintaining a personal log or notebook to track your progress, challenges, and areas of improvement. This will help you monitor your development throughout your journey at Techpro Academy.

By following this workflow, you can work independently on exercises, and draft pull requests will serve as notifications to instructors that exercises are completed. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the teaching team or your fellow Techpro Academy participants.

Happy coding and learning! 🚀👨‍💻👩‍💻

# Assignment 1: Customer Registration Form

In this assignment, you will create a simple customer registration form using JavaScript. Your script should do the following:

1. Declare variables to store information about a customer such as `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and `age`.
2. Use prompt() to collect this information from the user.
3. Validate the email address format using string manipulation and a comparison operator.
4. Check if the age is above 18 using a logical comparison.
5. Display a success message if all conditions are met; otherwise, display an error message.

Feel free to add comments to explain your code. Create an `index.html` file and include a script tag where you will write your JavaScript code.

Good luck!

# Shopping Cart Calculation

For this assignment, you will simulate a basic shopping cart calculation using JavaScript. Your script should accomplish the following tasks:

1. Declare an array of objects, each representing a product with properties such as `name`, `price`, and `quantity`.
2. Calculate the total cost of each product based on its price and quantity using arithmetic operators.
3. Sum up the total cost of all products in the shopping cart to get the final bill amount.
4. Display the final bill amount along with a list of all the products purchased.

Feel free to add comments to explain your code. Don't forget to create an `index.html` file and include a script tag where you will write your JavaScript code.

Best of luck!

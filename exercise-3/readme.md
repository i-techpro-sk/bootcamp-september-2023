# Boolean Logic in User Authentication

In this assignment, you will create a simple user authentication script using JavaScript. Your script should do the following:

1. Declare a variable to store the correct username and another variable for the correct password.
2. Use prompt() to collect the username and password from the user.
3. Check if both the username and password are correct using logical operators.
4. Display a success message if the authentication is successful; otherwise, display an error message.

Feel free to add comments to explain your code. Create an `index.html` file and include a script tag where you will write your JavaScript code.

Good luck!
